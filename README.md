# Custom-Dash-Player
This small project was aimed for the course Medientechnik at the FH Kufstein. The main intention was to build a simple MPEG-DASH streaming client with the use of Media Source Extensions (MSE). The playlist is only tested with one reference implementation. The files inside the stream folder should be served by a remote server. The CORS header should be set in the .htaccess file of this server.

## Have fun with it
